Fantastic. A strong README will turn this from “a repo” into a platform narrative.

Below is a founder-grade, Staff+-grade README you can paste into README.md and then tune.

I wrote this so it works for three audiences at once:
	•	senior engineers / interviewers
	•	product / strategy people
	•	future you as the system evolves

🧠 NotionWealth Intelligence

An Agentic Decision Intelligence Platform for Financial & Capital Strategy

⸻

Overview

NotionWealth Intelligence is an agentic decision platform that transforms fragmented financial disclosures into a continuously learning research, risk, and capital-intelligence system.

It is not a chatbot.

It is a multi-agent cognition layer designed to support:
	•	financial research
	•	risk and anomaly detection
	•	competitive intelligence
	•	portfolio-level reasoning
	•	capital allocation modeling
	•	traceable, replayable decision workflows

The core problem this system addresses is institutional cognition:

How do we build AI systems that do not just answer questions, but maintain memory, coordinate specialized agents, verify claims, replay past reasoning, and support real strategic and capital decisions?

System Capabilities

🔹 Ingestion Agents
	•	Ingest 10-Ks, 10-Qs, earnings decks, transcripts, and market PDFs
	•	Parse, chunk, embed, and persist financial knowledge
	•	Extract both:
	•	semantic memory (vector store)
	•	structured financial facts

🔹 Multi-Layer Memory
	•	Semantic memory: qualitative, contextual, narrative knowledge
	•	Structured financial memory: metrics, segments, growth, risks
	•	Research memory: persisted research sessions and traces

🔹 Specialized Research Agents
	•	Financial agent: performance, growth, margins, segments
	•	Risk & anomaly agent: regulatory, operational, financial drift
	•	Competitive intelligence agent: cross-company positioning
	•	Portfolio agent: exposure, concentration, strategy themes

🔹 Control Plane
	•	Task routing and orchestration
	•	Verification and evidence attachment
	•	Research session generation
	•	Trace, audit, and replay support

🔹 Synthesis & Decision Agents
	•	Investment memo generation
	•	Capital allocation modeling
	•	Portfolio-level reasoning
	•	Strategic scenario construction

🔹 Research Replay Engine
	•	Persisted research sessions
	•	Replay and diff against new data
	•	Institutional learning and audit trail

🔹 Product Layer (UI)
	•	Run research workflows
	•	View verified outputs
	•	Replay past decisions
	•	Generate memos and portfolio briefs

Why This System Exists

Most AI finance tools stop at:
	•	document Q&A
	•	retrieval-augmented chat
	•	static analysis scripts

They fail to address:
	•	institutional memory
	•	multi-agent specialization
	•	cross-company reasoning
	•	capital-level abstraction
	•	verification and auditability
	•	replay and learning over time

NotionWealth Intelligence was designed from the start as a decision platform, not a document tool.

Example Workflows

Financial Research
	•	Ingest Apple, Microsoft, Google filings
	•	Analyze revenue drivers and growth
	•	Attach sources and evidence
	•	Persist as a research session

Risk & Anomaly Analysis
	•	Compare risk language across years
	•	Detect regulatory clustering
	•	Identify financial irregularities
	•	Flag emerging threats

Competitive Intelligence
	•	Cross-company metric normalization
	•	Strategic positioning analysis
	•	Advantage and vulnerability mapping

Portfolio Strategy
	•	Exposure and concentration analysis
	•	Correlated risk detection
	•	Capital posture construction

Capital Allocation
	•	Scenario modeling
	•	Growth vs risk tradeoffs
	•	Rebalancing logic
	•	Decision memos

Research Replay
	•	Reload historical research
	•	Re-run with new data
	•	Diff outputs
	•	Track reasoning evolution

Running the System

1. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Add API key

Create .env:

GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here

3. Ingest documents

Place PDFs into:

data/raw/

Run ingestion or use UI.

4. Start MCP server

python mcp_server.py


⸻

5. Launch UI

streamlit run finance-agent/ui/app.py

Research Artifacts

Every research run generates:
	•	a structured research session
	•	evidence links
	•	agent execution traces
	•	optional replay capability

This enables:
	•	auditability
	•	verification
	•	institutional learning
	•	decision history

⸻

Design Philosophy
	•	Agents are specialists, not prompts
	•	Memory is stratified, not flat
	•	Verification is mandatory
	•	Traces are first-class artifacts
	•	Replay is a core system primitive
	•	Outputs are decision surfaces, not answers

⸻

Roadmap
	•	Live data connectors
	•	Signal compounding
	•	Portfolio correlation modeling
	•	Confidence scoring
	•	Multi-portfolio management
	•	Enterprise governance layer

⸻

Status

Current version:
v0.1 — Decision Intelligence Platform Baseline

This version establishes:
	•	ingestion layer
	•	multi-agent research fabric
	•	control plane
	•	replay engine
	•	portfolio reasoning
	•	decision UI
